### About the modpack

### Versioning
The versioning format is `<MC version>-x.y.z`, where:

- `<MC version>` means for which version of Minecraft modpack update applies
- `x` is a mod list revision (addition/removal of a mod)
- `y` is the config revision (for example: default config for Sodium was changed)
- `z` means that some mod has been updated and no substantial changes otherwise.

Also, with every Minecraft release - `x.y.z` resets to 1.0.0 because for every Minecraft version different mod sets presented.
